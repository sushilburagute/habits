# Project Implementation Summary

## Overview

- React + TypeScript habit tracking UI scaffold with theming, navigation state, and IndexedDB persistence.
- Application currently renders navigation header within the layout shell; other features exist in the data layer and hooks.

## Application Shell & Navigation

- src/App.tsx composes ThemeProvider, AppProvider, and layout Container around the Header.
- src/components/Header.tsx renders brand title, navigation links from src/constants/links.ts, a placeholder "create habit" button, and ThemeToggle; clicking links dispatches SET_ROUTE in context.
- src/components/Container.tsx provides responsive outer/inner wrappers used for layout spacing.
- src/contexts/AppContext.tsx defines global state with
  oute (default oday), reducer, and useAppContext hook.

## Theming & UI Components

- src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx stores the theme (light | dark | system) in localStorage, applies root classes, and exposes useTheme.
- src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx uses a Radix dropdown populated with theme options and an icon button to switch themes.
- src/components/ui/button.tsx and src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx wrap shadcn/Radix primitives with project styling tokens (cn, ButtonVariants) for consistent UI.

## Data Layer & Persistence

- src/db/index.ts initializes IndexedDB ("habits") with object stores habits, icks, and meta, plus relevant indexes.
- src/db/repo.ts implements CRUD-like operations: createHabit, updateHabit, getAllHabits, setTick, oggleToday, getMonthMap, getAllToday, and computeStreaks (current/longest streak computation with a naive scan).
- src/db/sync.ts provides an intra-tab event bus using EventTarget and BroadcastChannel to emit (emitDBEvent) and subscribe (onDBEvent) to habit/tick changes.
- src/db/time.ts exposes localDayISO helper to normalize dates to the user's timezone; src/db/seed.ts seeds demo habits and ticks.

## Reactive Hooks

- src/hooks/useDB.ts provides useHabits, useMonthMap, useStreaks, and useTodaySummary, each subscribing to relevant DB events to keep React state in sync.

## Styling & Design Tokens

- src/index.css imports Tailwind, defines light/dark CSS custom properties for the color system, sets Tailwind @theme tokens, and applies base styles.
- src/lib/utils.ts exposes cn helper combining clsx and ailwind-merge for class collation.

## PWA & Tooling

- vite.config.ts enables React and Tailwind plugins plus vite-plugin-pwa with manifest metadata, icon set (public/icons/\*), and runtime caching strategies.
- package.json scripts cover dev/build/lint/preview; dependencies include Radix UI, idb, Tailwind, and lucide icons.
- eslint.config.js configures TypeScript + React linting; sconfig\*.json define module resolution (alias @ -> src).

## Observed Gaps / Next Steps

- UI currently renders only the header; heatmap visualizations, habit creation flow, and streak displays referenced in README.md remain unimplemented.
- src/components/Header.tsx "create habit" button lacks a handler; navigation state drives styling but no route-specific views exist yet.
- Data hooks and repo methods are prepared but unused in UI pending page components.
- PWA runtime caching includes a placeholder API origin (api.example.com) that may require adjustment before production.
